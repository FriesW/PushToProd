# Assembly Guide

Want your own PushToProd button? This guide will step you through assembly.

Assembling the PushToProd button is relatively easy. The most difficult
part is soldering wires to the LEDs. Only basic soldering skills are needed.
No knowledge of electronics or programming is required. All adhesion is done
with hot glue, and there are no "waiting" steps.

Due to the wide array of laser cutters available, this guide does not go
through the steps of engraving and cutting materials. It is assumed that is
already done. That said, the pdf files in the repository are built to work
with Epilog software, so it should be straightforward with Epilog systems.
